            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Machine learning is an important part of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being specifically programmed for each task. This powerful technology is changing many industries, from healthcare to finance, by making it easier to predict outcomes, automate tasks, and make smarter decisions. This case study covers the basics of machine learning, its types, how it works, its various uses, and the challenges in applying it, showing its vital role in advancing technology.</p>
          </section>
          
          <section>
            <h2>Machine Learning Overview</h2>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) is a field within AI and computer science that focuses on using data and algorithms to help computers learn in a way that mimics human learning, gradually improving their accuracy. It enables computers to find patterns and make predictions or decisions based on data without being directly programmed for every scenario. As computers process more data, they get better at making accurate predictions. ML is used in many areas, like personalized recommendations, self-driving cars, and voice recognition, making computers learn from experience, similar to how people do.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Supervised Learning</li>
              <p>This type of ML uses labeled data to train a model, where the correct answers are already known. The model learns to map inputs to the correct outputs so it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.</p>
              <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
              <p>Here, the model looks for patterns in data that isn’t labeled. It learns from the data without any specific guidance, making it more flexible and capable of discovering hidden patterns.</p>
              <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
              <p>In this approach, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn a strategy that maximizes rewards over time.</p>
            </ul>
          </section>

                  <li>Data Collection:</li>
                  <p>Involves gathering data from various sources, such as historical records or online data, to train the algorithms. For example, banks use past data to assess creditworthiness, while online data is used to detect fraud or personalize content.</p>
                  <li>Preprocessing:</li>
                  <p>This step involves cleaning and preparing data to make it suitable for training. Good preprocessing can significantly improve the performance of machine learning models.</p>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                Model Training, Evaluation, and Tuning:
                <ul>
                  <li>Training:</li>
                  <p>The model learns from the data, adjusting its parameters to reduce errors and improve its accuracy.</p>
                  <li>Evaluation:</li>
                  <p>The model is tested on new data to check how well it can predict or classify correctly.</p>
                  <li>Tuning:</li>
                  <p>Adjusting the model’s settings to make it as accurate as possible based on its performance.</p>
                </ul>
              </li>

            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>
              Computers are classified into categories like mainframe, mini, and microcomputers, based on their processing power and size. Mainframes are powerful machines used in large-scale operations, such as banking and airline systems, where data processing demands are extensive. Minicomputers, smaller and less powerful than mainframes, are often utilized in research labs and small businesses for tasks like word processing and database management. Microcomputers, including desktops and laptops, dominate consumer markets due to their affordability, compact size, and versatility, serving purposes such as entertainment, office work, and education.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets represent a convergence of portability and computing power, enabling communication, multimedia consumption, and light office work. Specialized computers, such as servers and wearable devices, further cater to niche functionalities, from supporting networks to providing real-time health monitoring. The diversity in computer types reflects their adaptability to evolving needs, making them indispensable across various domains.
